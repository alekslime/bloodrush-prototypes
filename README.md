# Bloodrush
This is the main showroom of Bloodrush, a fast 3D FPS.

You are a test subject of futuristic enemies—machines that harvest blood and human flesh as their main source of power. Earth has fallen, and you're the last surviving human. Hunted through devastated cities and ruined labs, your only chance is escape. But you're not defenseless. Left behind by your ancestors is a sword—primitive, yet powerful. In a world ruled by steel and circuits, it’s your only weapon. Run, fight, and survive in this fast-paced, brutal 3D FPS.
